# Simple-Coding-Language
 This HTML document constitutes a Simple Custom Coding Language IDE, enabling users to input code featuring the 'print()' function and basic operations, with execution results displayed in a dark-themed interface.

 The IDE where you can code in this language is live [**here**](https://ahujaesh.github.io/Simple-Coding-Language/)!

**Rules** / **Instructions**:
- the only function in this very basic code is print();
- You can add text within " " (Double Quotes) and use operations such as *, /, +, and, - .
- There is no Header Statements required
- For example, a full code might look like
  
print("Hello world");

print("Your lucky number is " + 3+4+5/6);
- Have fun!

**How does this work?**
The HTML page takes the input from the user, splits it into parts by semicolons (;), finds what starts with ¨print¨ ( and ends with ¨)¨ and computes it, and then prints it out with a line break. It isn´t really a programming language, but its good enough for me.
